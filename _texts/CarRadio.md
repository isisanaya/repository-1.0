-[Verse 1]

- I ponder of something great
- My lungs will fill and then deflate
- They fill with fire
- Exhale desire
- I know it's dire
- My time today


- [Chorus]

- I have these thoughts
- So often I ought
- To replace that slot
- With what I once bought
- Cause somebody stole
- My car radio
- And now I just sit in silence


- [Verse 2]

- Sometimes quiet is violent
- I find it hard to hide it
- My pride is no longer inside
- It's on my sleeve
- My skin will scream
- Reminding me of
- Who I killed inside my dream
- I hate this car that I'm driving
- There's no hiding for me
- I'm forced to deal with what I feel
- There is no distraction to mask what is real
- I could pull the steering wheel


- [Chorus]

- I have these thoughts
- So often I ought
- To replace that slot
- With what I once bought
- Cause somebody stole
- My car radio
- And now I just sit in silence


- [Verse 3]

- I ponder of something terrifying
- Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
- I find over the course of our human existence
- One thing consists of consistence
- And it's that we're all battling fear
- Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
- Oh my too deep - please stop thinking
- I liked it better when my car had sound
- There are things we can do
- But from the things that work there are only two
- And from the two that we choose to do
- Peace will win
- And fear will lose
- There's faith and there's sleep
- We need to pick one please because
- Faith is to be awake
- And to be awake is for us to think
- And for us to think is to be alive
- And I will try with every rhyme
- To come across like I am dying
- To let you know you need to try to think
 

- [Chorus]

- I have these thoughts
- So often I ought
- To replace that slot
- With what I once bought
- Cause somebody stole
- My car radio
- And now I just sit in silence


- [Bridge]

- And now I just sit in silence
- And now I just sit in silence
- And now I just sit
- And now I just sit in silence
- And now I just sit in silence
- And now I just sit in silence
- And now I just sit


- [Verse 1]

- I ponder of something great
- My lungs will fill and then deflate
- They fill with fire
- Exhale desire
- I know it's dire
- My time today
 

- [Chorus]

- I have these thoughts
- So often I ought
- To replace that slot
- With what I once bought
- Cause somebody stole
- My car radio
- And now I just sit in silence
