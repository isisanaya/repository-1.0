- The following pages are the songs of Twenty One Pilots's, <i>Vessel<i>. 
- This album, released in 2012 by their label <i>Fuled By Ramen<i>, is their third album. 
- Vessel follows the band's first album <i>Regional At Best</i> which was taken offline 
- Due to the band switching labels /(<i>to Fuled By Ramen<i>)/. 
- Their first title ablum put out by Fuled By Ramen, <i>Twenty One Pilots</i> got 
- them many new fans and once <i>Vessel</i> came out, their fan base was increasingly getting
- stronger, getting them their first performance at the APMAs[^fn1]. 

- Here, I will be analyzing <i>Vessel</i> , and offereing my interpretation of the lyrics 
- of each song off the album. 
- My knowledge comes from being a fan since the boys performed at the 2014 APMAs. 
- Some also comes from reading Genius.com, and reading other fan theories, but 
- Though these meanings wont be unique to just me, ultimately, these conclusions will come from me.
