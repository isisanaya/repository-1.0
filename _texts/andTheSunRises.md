- A calm blue light settles into a rehabilitative lull behind my eyes,
- {:.indent-3} the tornado of emotions coming to a resting point. 

- The excitement that the unknown sent to my front door,
- {:.indent-3} is seald for when the earth reopens it again.

- Rain flows down the gutter of my arms and into my heart. 
- {:.indent-3} and back out into the abyss of immorality. 

- The energies of the universe that formed to create character,
- {:.indent-3} Fall too, in this fiery state.
- {:.indent-4} Fire that crackels, and grows, and eats hungrily away and other powers,
- {:.indent-5} Also shrinks into queit, heat filled, embers. 

- And everything that's wrong in the world, 
- {:.indent-3} The underground, upside-down, paranormal negativity, 
- Weighs itself in, on the scale of my concious. 

- {:.indent-3} Hopefully bright light outweighs the heavy shadows of guilt. 

- And when the day is done,
- {:.indent-3} This is what creeps back into my mind to rejuvenate my soul.
