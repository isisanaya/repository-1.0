- [Verse 1]

- Now the night is coming to an end
- The sun will rise and we will try again


- [Chorus]

- Stay alive, stay alive for me
- You will die, but now your life is free
- Take pride in what is sure to die


- [Verse 2]

- I will fear the night again
- I hope I'm not my only friend


- [Chorus]

- Stay alive, stay alive for me
- You will die, but now your life is free
- Take pride in what is sure to die
